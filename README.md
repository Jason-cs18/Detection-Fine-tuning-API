# Detection-Fine-tuning-API
Because detection-models (Yolo, Mask-RCNN, etc) are often developed by the different frameworks and evaluate the performance on different hardwares, it's hard to evaluate the performance (i.e, fps). This project builds all detection-models on keras-tensorflow and provides the general API for training, fine-tuning and detection.
